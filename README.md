# Android Development in 24 Hrs

**I tried to learn the basics of Android Development in 24 hrs**

This repository is not well structured and maintained as i was learning from a youtube series which was quite old and android has depricated and added new features in the mean while. 

It contains everything i got working but it is not recommended to refer to any material from this repository.

This was a test to check if i have intrest in Android Development and if i would like to learn it properly and develop android apps, so i tried to learn it in 24 hrs. This approach did two things 

1. saved me a lot of time by packing basics of android in a small amount of time rather than spending 40-50 Hrs on a good course and maybe at the end realized that i may not like android development that much.

2. it was just fun to learn android (or any other skill) in kind of a Hacakathon type style.


## Directories 

**01_Kotlin** -> Basics of Kotlin Programming Language (Official language for Android Development)


**02_Development** -> Hands-on of Android Studio and making a very basic app(it might not even be a considered an app ğŸ˜¬)
